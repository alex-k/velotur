<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Russia! The good news is that we  do not have snow all year round, and the bears are not so common on the city  streets! This alone makes Russia a good place for cycling. But there is much  more to it because Russia is unique in many ways. </p>
<p>First, it is the country&rsquo;s vast spaces. The  size of Russia&rsquo;s forests can compare with that of an average European country.  Its lakes compete with the Great Lakes of America, and beat by size some of the  seas. <br>
      Second, the richness of Russia&rsquo;s history,  including the recent history, would impress any inquisitive mind.  We compose all our itineraries so that you  could get acquainted with the history of Russia. <br>
  Any country&rsquo;s history is always reflected  in its architecture. The visitors will see impressive fortresses, ancient  Orthodox churches, magnificent imperial palaces, Art Nouveau buildings, modern towers, and lots more. </p>
    <p>Then, there is the diversity. The dynamic  life of cities contrasts with peaceful rural lifestyle of the villages. Many  peoples originating from different parts of the Russian Empire have contributed  to its cultural heritage. And what is a better way of tasting this diversity  than Russian cuisine? Along with delicious Russian dishes, you can taste  Ukrainian, Georgian, Tatar, Uzbek, and many other specialties.<br>
      A few words about the city of Saint  Petersburg where we are based... One of the world&rsquo;s wonders, it was created in  a unique natural environment of the mighty River Neva&rsquo;s delta by the will of  Russian Emperor Peter the Great and the talent of renown architects from all  over Europe. They were supported by financial power of the empire, and inspired  by the Russian concept of space and perspective. Come and see, and you will  fall in love with this city.<br>
      While we, the natives of Saint Petersburg  get jealous when someone praises Moscow, we must admit its unbeatable vibe,  character, and charm. You will be able to judge yourselves.</p>
    <p>Talking about the practical side,  travelling with us is simple. We offer comfortable double room accommodation,  delicious restaurants, an accompanying van, and reliable hybrid bikes.  Naturally, our highly experienced cycling guides speak English, some of them  will also greet you in German, French, or Spanish.</p>
    <p>In addition to enjoying tourist landmarks,  we try to help you dive into the local life. Going to the country store,  chatting to locals, swimming in the lake (a must for the Russians), an outdoor  barbeque (shashlik), and a traditional Russian Sauna – all this will make your  Russian adventure an unforgettable experience.</p>

<h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day. Tour of St.Petersburg. Departure by night train</h3>
<p>In the morning, we take you on a walking tour of the city centre. We  start at bustling Nevsky Prospect, walk along the canals, visit Palace square,  see magnificent Winter Palace, Admiralty, St. Isaac&rsquo;s Cathedral and other  landmark sites of St.Petersburg.<br>
      Your afternoon is free but we will offer you the options of a city  tour on the bike, boat trip on city&rsquo;s rivers and canals, and a visit to the  Hermitage or Russian Museum.<br>
In the evening, we take an overnight train to our destination in  Pskov Region.</p>
<div style="float: left"><img src="levels/03.jpg" width="64" height="64" alt=""/></div>   
    <h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day. Suschevo – Sacred Hills</h3>
    <p>      On arrival, we find ourselves in a quiet rural railway station of  Suschovo. Our van will meet us here with our bikes. After bike fitting, we hit  the road aiming for Sacred Hills. This name was recently returned to this  little town that for decades was called Pushkin Hills, after the famous Russian  poet and writer Alexander Pushkin who spent here several years in his family  estate. Nowadays the entire area is the National Park preserving historical and  cultural heritage along with inspiring landscapes. The town is dominated with  the Sacred Hills Monastery.</p>
<div style="float: left"><img src="levels/04.jpg" width="64" height="64" alt=""/></div>
    <h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day. Exploring Pushkin National Park</h3>
    <p>      Today we explore the National Park on the bike. Quiet side roads  lead us to well preserved XVII-XIX century estates - you will recognize the  settings of which you read in classical Russian books, or saw in the movies.  Wooden mansions, beautiful parks, quiet alleys are in natural harmony with  wheat fields, shining lakes, rolling hills, and forests. </p>
<div style="float: left"><img src="levels/05.jpg" width="64" height="64" alt=""/></div>
    <h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day. Sacred Hills – Ostrov</h3>
    <p>      We will start this day on the asphalt but will soon leave it, and  make our way to Ostrov on a dirt road winding among the fields and forests,  along the River Velikaya (The Great), passing by old tiny villages. While  unsealed road is a bit of a challenge, we will be rewarded by the beauty of  surroundings and almost non-existent traffic.<br>
      Ostrov was established in XIII century. In addition to the old  churches and houses, the town owes its charm to unique chain bridges over River  Velikaya.</p>
<div style="float: left"><img src="levels/06.jpg" width="64" height="64" alt=""/></div>
     <h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day. Ostrov – Izborsk</h3>
     <p>      Today we cycle through the lands at the western edges of Russia that  saw many battles through the ages. Around Ostrov we see fortifications built  prior to World War II. As we approach Izborsk, high on the hill we will see an  impressive stone fortress. The legend reads that Izborsk was the capital of  Prince Truvor, younger brother of Prince Ryurik – the Viking who was invited to  rule Russia in the IX century. The massive fortress was built in XIV century,  and defended Russian lands against attacks of Livonian knights. Inside the  fortress ramparts, we will see a gorgeous St. Nicolas church built in XIV  century. There are a few nice chapels around the fortress. We can also visit  the picturesque Slavonic Springs.</p>
<div style="float: left"><img src="levels/07.jpg" width="64" height="64" alt=""/></div>
    <h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day. Visit to Pechorsky Monastery</h3>
    <p>    Through the beautiful scenery, we ride to the Pechorsky Monastery,  one of the few in Russia that remained monasteries through the Soviet era. Its  colorful domes are seen from afar, and the view is often supplemented by the  music of the bells. The entire monastery looks like a scene from an old Russian  fairy tale. </p>
<div style="float: left"><img src="levels/08.jpg" width="64" height="64" alt=""/></div>
    <h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day. Izborsk – Pskov </h3>
    <p>      The quiet side roads lead us to Pskov. We hope to get there by noon,  leaving some time to enjoy this lovely city.   Between X and XV century Pskov was the capital of an independent feudal  state, and even today we can see the traces of its glory. First, it is the  white-stone Pskov Kremlin on the banks of River Velikaya. We will also see some  nice wooden houses and white-stone churches all around the city.<br>
    In the evening, we take the night train to Moscow.</p>
<div style="float: left"><img src="levels/09.jpg" width="64" height="64" alt=""/></div>    
    <h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day. Moscow</h3>
    <p>    Upon arrival, we will check in our hotel, and then go on a walking  tour of Moscow, including the Kremlin and Red Square.

    <h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day. Arrival  in St.Petersburg, transfer to your hotel, and the dinner</h3>
    <div style="clear: both"></div>
<div style="float: left"><img src="levels/02.jpg" width="64" height="64" alt=""/></div>
<h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day.  Transfer to Roschino, cycling Roschino – Vyborg</h3>
<p>      In the  morning, we start with one  hour transfer to  Roschino where we meet with our escort vehicle. Here you will get your rental  bikes or assemble, with our help, your own ones. We change into our cycling  gear, and hit the road! <br>
      Today we ride  through the Karelian Isthmus lying between the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga  – the largest lake in Europe. The landscape here was formed in the end of the  ice age by the receding glacier which left behind hundreds of lakes. We ride  mostly on the asphalt but also enjoy some forest roads. <br>
      We end the day  in the medieval town of Vyborg. It was established by the Swedish knights, and  through its history changed hands multiple times between Sweden, Finland, and  Russia. The medieval knights&rsquo; castle, the only one in Russia, dominates the  town. We also see some medieval homes, along with nice examples of Nordic Classicism and Art Nouveau remaining from the times of the Finnish rule.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day. Vyborg  – Lake Vuoksa</h3>
    <p>      Today we keep  cycling through pristine Karelian landscape featuring pine forests and endless  lakes. We end the day in a guesthouse on the bank of Lake Vuoksa. We will  experience traditional Russian sauna and swim in the lake. We will have a  barbeque dinner, having a  choice between meat, fish, and vegetables.</p>

<div style="float: left"><img src="levels/04.jpg" width="64" height="64" alt=""/></div>
    <h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day. Lake  Vuoksa – Losevo</h3>
    <p>      We start the  days cycling on a quiet asphalt road, then ride through the forests, and reach  Losevo. This village is well known among outdoor enthusiasts for the Losevo Rapids.  Here a large river goes through the narrows, running between the rocks and  forming impressive vortexes. The rapids traditionally host kayaking and rafting  competitions. We are not going to compete but will have a chance to pass  through the rapids on a raft with  an experienced instructor.</p>
    <div align="center"><img src="cycling_in_russia/vr03.jpg" width="100%" alt=""/></div>
<div style="float: left"><img src="levels/05.jpg" width="64" height="64" alt=""/></div>
    <h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day. Losevo  – Lake Ladoga</h3>
    <p>      Today the  asphalt will make up less than a half of our journey. In this rural countryside  we will enjoy beautiful nature and nice architecture. On a tiny island on Lake  Vuoksa we will find a traditional Russian Orthodox Church of St. Andrew. We  will also stop by a Lutheran Church build in Nordic Modern style.<br>
      We will stay  in the hotel near Lake Ladoga. The wooded coast has many little bays and  islands adjacent to the shore, and we will enjoy the views of Ladoga sherries.</p>
    <div align="center"><img src="cycling_in_russia/vr04.jpg" width="100%" alt=""/></div>

    <h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day. Lake  Ladoga – Lahdenpohya – transfer to Sortavala</h3>
    <p>      We continue  our journey on a dirt road, and cross the former border to what was Finland  before 1940. Hilly road takes us through the woods and passes along few bays of  Lake Ladoga with crystal clear waters. We cycle to Lahdenpohya from where we  transfer to Sortavala – a nice town on the shores of Lake Ladoga. Our hotel  overlooks the lake.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="cycling_in_russia/vr05.jpg" width="100%" alt=""/></div>
<div style="float: left"><img src="levels/07.jpg" width="64" height="64" alt=""/></div>
<h3 style="color: #ea7806">Day. Boat  trip to Valaam Archipelago</h3>
<p>      Today is one  of the trip highlights. We take a boat to go to the Valaam Archipelago known as  a &ldquo;Pearl of the Russian North&rdquo;. Remoteness  of Valaam, along with its natural beauty attracted the monks to settle here in  XI century. This settlement later became a Monastery. Today we see an extraordinary architectural  ensemble built into exceptional natural environment. The churches and chapels  are often surrounded by century-old firs, and they are dispersed across the  islands, some of which are connected with the bridges. As a bonus for us, there  is no car traffic on the archipelago, and we spend the day exploring it on the bike.<br>
      In the  evening, we take the boat back to Sortavala, and stay in the same hotel.</p>
